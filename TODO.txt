Ideas:

Sliders to ctrl env var. (Initial conditions)
Options to add disasters/extinction events. (can be randomized)
Add visuals for gene data. (1 gene dedicated to color of cell)
Figure out dictionary.
Write pseudo code for NN.

Darwin - working on rendering engine
Agam - working on Physics engine and NN pseudocode

More energy a cell has stored, slower their lifespan clock ticks.
Add neuron that allows cells to spit out food. (For hunters, this will induce parenting, and for plants, it will promote symbiotic relationships)
The excrement of cells not relying on photosynthesis increases local nutrients thus wanting plants to attract hunters, etc.
When a cell dies, it releases some unused energy stored(similar to slither.io) and for some time, a massive local boost to nutrients occurs where the cell died. This should develop plants that are able to attract and kill huntersâ€¦
Allow plants and hunters to develop poison neurons that contain information regarding if the cell is killed and eaten by another cell and if thy contain a specific neuron(match gene), kill that neuron.
